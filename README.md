# ValidateFloatNumber
Validate if a number is a float

PROJECT TITLE: ValidateFloatNumber
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to validate if a number is a float
VERSION or DATE: 06/10/20
AUTHORS: Ivy P.
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Using loops with the String and Character classes. You can also use the StringBuilder class to concatenate all the error messages.

Floating point literals can be expressed as digits with one decimal point or using scientific notation.

The only valid characters are digits (0 through 9) At most one decimal point.
At most one occurrence of the letter ‘E’ At most two positive or negative signs.

examples of valid expressions:

3.14159
-2.54
2.453E3
66.3E-5

Write a class definition file that has a String field to hold a possible floating point number.
Name this  class “ValidateFloat”.

Write a method in ValidateFloat that returns true if the String is a valid floating point literal and false if it is not valid.

Use other methods in your ValidateFloat class to create a modular solution.

Write a Driver class with main( ) that prompts the user to enter candidate strings and prints a message stating whether the entry is a valid floating point number or not. For 10 additional extra credit points, print all the reasons why an expression that is not valid fails the tests. Remember, all the printing is done in main( ). Use a StringBuilder field in the ValidateFloat class to concatenate all the errors with the candidate string.

The program ends when the user enters “quit”.

Note: the Driver class does all the printing. The ValidateFloat class does no printing.
